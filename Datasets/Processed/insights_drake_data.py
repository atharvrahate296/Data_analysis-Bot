# --- Data Analysis Report ---

# The dataset provides insights into track views, with initial exploration revealing a wide range of values.  A primary focus is understanding the distribution of track views and potential outliers.
# *   Track views exhibit a right-skewed distribution, indicating that the majority of tracks have relatively lower views, while a few tracks have significantly higher views.
# *   The average track view is influenced by the presence of outliers, which can be observed through descriptive statistics and box plots.

# Further analysis examines the relationship between track views and other potential factors.
# *   Visualizations, such as scatter plots, are used to explore any correlations between track views and other numerical variables.
# *   Box plots are used to examine the distribution of track views across different albums or categories.

# Finally, the presence of outliers in track views is investigated to understand their impact on overall statistics and visualizations. Addressing outliers may involve transformations or other statistical techniques to ensure a more accurate representation of the data's underlying patterns.
